# ML-python-pytorch-cnn-gpu-service

Quickstart project for executing an MNIST classifier using the PyTorch framework on a GPU.

Running pip install requirements.txt and then python `app.py` will start the app on localhost where the user can send GET requests to perform inference.

eg .../mnist/{index} where index is in the range [0:784]
